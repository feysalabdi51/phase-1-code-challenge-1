In challenge one; ChaiCalculator:

When you run the code, it will ask "Enter number of cups:"
Type in a number (e.g. 3) and hit enter.
It’ll then calculate the amount of:

Water (200ml per cup)
Milk (50ml per cup)
Tea Leaves (1 tablespoon per cup)
Sugar (2 teaspoons per cup)

Example Output:
If you enter 2, the output will be:

For 2 cup(s) of chai:
 Water: 400 ml
 Milk: 100 ml
 Tea Leaves: 2 tbsp
 Sugar: 4 tsp

If you enter 0 or something that isn’t a number, it tells you it’s invalid.





In challenge two; bodaFareCalculator:

When you run the code, a prompt will pop up asking:

"Unafika wapi Mkubwa? Kilometer ngapi?"

Just enter the number of kilometers you're traveling.

If you put in an invalid number (like letters or a negative number), it tells you to try again.

It calculates your fare using this formula:

Base Fare: KES 50

Charge per km: KES 15

Then it shows you a breakdown like:

Uko kwote? To ni 3 km:
Ukikalia Pikipiki: KES 50
Mpaka Uko: KES 45
Total: KES 95
Panda Pikipiki!




In challenge three; mobileMoneyEstimator:

This is a small JavaScript function that asks how much money you're sending, then calculates the transaction fee (1.5% of the amount).
If the fee is less than or equal to 10, it charges KES 10.
If the fee is more than 70, it caps at KES 70.
Otherwise, it uses the actual 1.5% fee.

It shows an alert with:
The amount you're sending
The transaction cost
The total amount (what you'll be charged)
