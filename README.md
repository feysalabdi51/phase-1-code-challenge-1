Chai & Boda Utility Tools


A set of simple, beginner-friendly programs written to calculate chai preparation ingredients, boda fare estimation, and mobile money transaction fees. Ideal for learners exploring user input, conditional logic, and arithmetic in programming.

 Project Description

This project contains three mini applications:

1. ChaiCalculator

Calculates ingredients needed for a given number of cups of chai (tea).
Prompt: Enter number of cups:
